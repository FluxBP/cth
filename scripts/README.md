These are sample and utility scripts that can be run with `cth --exec`.

Scripts are similar to testcases since they can load the test libraries (see e.g. the `chaindir-example` script) which give them access to the test drivers. The main difference is that scripts don't generate pass/fail reports for a test suite. Otherwise, like tests, they are standalone executable programs and thus they can do anything.
